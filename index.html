            <p>
                Before we go deeper into this, I just want to say that being an adult is not an easy thing, no matter how ready you are feeling right now. I personally wanted to live away from home ever since I got into high school because it's just stressful living with parents. I was thrilled thinking about all the freedome I would have once move out, however I was not ready for a completely new environment, new city, new people, new dialect when I moved out for university. Dealing with loneliness and impostor syndrome is real, no joke.<br>
                After one year of adjusting and adapting, I was able to make new friends, have my first job, and was happier. I've changed a lot after 3 years living alone, I've seen myself grown too, so I hope you will so as well once you move out. All the best!

                <p>
                    This might not something unexpected, but it's crucial to be pointed out. Moving is hectic.<br>
                    I don't know much about the environment you will move in like the life in the States, but I think you should prepare yourself, at least mentally that you would have to handle a lot of stuff on your own, from looking for a place to rent, to figuring out the utilities, and implementing furnitures. <br>
                    I will not go much into detail on this matter because who I am to say, I know nothing about the States lol. So here are some general advice:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Search the area up on google map, look at the surroundings it would be much much more convenience if there are supermarkets and bus stations near your house.</li>
                        <li>No matter how stupid this might sounds, you should watch some youtube videos of the people who are living in the same area as yours or at least in the same city, I think there are a bunch of <em>moving vlogs</em> on there for you to watch. If you're shy, you can watch them in secret, no one will judge.</li>
                        <li>Last but not least, make sure your door is always lock and keep yourself safe.</li>
                    </ul>

                    Hmm, I don’t know why I have this section but you give me an introvert vibe so yea. If I’m right, great! If I’m wrong, well, you can skim through this part. <br>
                    As an introvert myself, making new friends was a real challenge. Over the past three years I have been trying to open up and initiate conversations with random people more, part of the reason why I joined the discord was also to make myself talk more.<br> 
                    <strong><em>Friends are important.</em></strong> Keeping one or two friends by your side helps a lot. They are the ones who you can share your day with, share your feelings and thoughts, sometimes they can even help you with your problems if you share it with them. <br>
                    Having a friend, or some friends to talk to, is something to keep yourself sane while battling loneliness while living alone.

                <p>
                    There will be times when you feel sad. For no reason at all. Random sadness is what I call it. Or maybe it’s not very random, but it’s an unexpected moment, when you suddenly got strucked by sadness. And it’s completely fine. I really don’t know for sure if you have ever experience this type of feeling, because the nature of men, most of them doesn’t like sharing their insecurities and I assume that admitting their sadness is one of these insecurities. Or maybe I’m just stereotyping. I don’t know, this is coming from my own experience anyway, and random sadness is what I occasionally get.<br>
                    I used to be a positive person, my positivity was quite toxic to be honest, that is why I stop being positive all the time and admit that I am feeling unwell sometimes. I don’t show it on like social media and stuff, but you already saw my rants in the server sometimes, so I guess you understand what I am talking about. <br>
                    Here are my method of dealing with random sadness: <br>
        
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong><em>I cry if I feel like crying.</em></strong> Admitting this used to be impossible for me three years ago, I don’t like showing or telling others about my insecurities and weak moments, but after some times, mostly by consulting with my boss who is a psychologist you might have already know, I feel more comfortable admitting these type of things to a certain extent. I mean, we are human anyway, and human have their own emotions, and it’s completely normal if it gets overwhelming sometimes. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong><em>I try to let go of that negative thought.</em></strong> This is quite the impossible but yea, sometimes an effort makes a different. I usually listen to a jazz or lofi playlist or watch something fun on youtube to distract my brain from thinking. Works sometimes, not all the time, but still worth the try I guess. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong><em>Telling myself that everything will be ok.</em></strong> Another dumb advice but still, it does help to calm you down sometimes. I used to have anxiety attack, not often but sometimes I will get very anxious about something I did like a week ago, and couldn’t go to sleep. So yea, telling myself that everything will be ok the next morning helps. My explanation on anxiety or random sadness is because I am drained mentally after a long day that it becomes vulnerable and easily to get triggered on bad memories. That is why I became a morning person after nearly a decade of being a night owl, I try to sleep early, especially when I’m tired, going to bed before my brain have the time to dig through my memory and pick out something to grieve or anxious about. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    Stress management.

                <p>
                    Stress is not something unfamiliar to all of us, well if you’re a 5 years old kid then maybe you have no idea what stress is, but I strongly believe that is not the case here. <br>
                    If you want to go into psychology, you must have known already that there are many types of stress. There are stress that helps you to be productive and get things done, but there are also stress that drags you down. I wouldn’t say that I have experienced all types of stress but one thing I can say for sure is that I get stressed very, VERY, often. Quote from my boss who is also my psychologist <em>“You (I) doesn’t have a weak mental capability at all, but for some reason you (I) can’t manage your stress.”</em> So, my conclusion from that quote is that even for someone who is mentally strong, they can still be affected by stress. <br>
                    So here is some advice on how to manage your stress from someone is bad at stress management (sounds very valid right?) <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong><em>Don’t bottle up your feelings.</em></strong> This is something that I have a problem with for a very long time, I don’t talk about my feelings much and it makes all these negative feelings built up and once stress hit me, it overflows.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong><em>If you’re feeling overwhelmed, just take a break, from anything.</em></strong> I took a break from socializing when my stress level was hitting the ceiling and I was yelling at people for some minor things. It could be different to you, maybe in your case you would need socializing to release those stress, or you need to take a break from work, or from being productive, it really depends but the general idea is: if you are feeling like shit is about to be blown out of control, just slow down, take a stop if needed, readjust yourself, and start again. And if anyone ask, you can tell them or not, your choice, about what you are feeling like, I believe if they see you as a friend, they will understand, like how my friends did.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong><em>Try to not procrastinate too much.</em></strong> I know, procrastination is fun, but hear me out. It will only be fun until your deadline got closer and you only have like 2 days to finish a report which was assigned to you 7 days ago. My strategy on procrastication is to make a to-do list, simple but helpful. You’ll only need to do a small portion of the assignment each day, you might still have to go on grind mode at the due date but it would be less stressful since at least you got some parts of it done already.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    Ok last part, if you’re still reading, lmao, you’ve made it to the almost end of this survival guide (which I really don’t know if its useful or not). <br>
                    This is something I believe all your parents have been telling you, or maybe not. Talking about this makes me feel old, but here’s the thing, reality is always cruel, you cannot be young forever, and time will make that body of yours suffer if you don’t take a good care of it now. <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong><em>Go to bed.</em></strong> This might sounds simple but we all know how hard it is to go to sleep when we need to. Getting enough sleep in the right time will boost your serotonins and helps you feel much better during the day. I’ve become a morning person for this reason, I realized that I am more productive in the morning time and getting things done is not that big of a problem anymore. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong><em>Drink water.</em></strong> Yes, another simple task but for some reason we tend to let our body dehydrated asf. By drinking enough water, you’ll not only feel better, but your skin will also starts to clear up on acne and pimples. This is TMI but to let you know how important water is to ur body, I will take my period as an example. Losing blood kind of similar to losing water from your body, at a certain point when I started to get cold sweats and blurry vision due to blood loss, drinking a cup of water keeps me alive to this day. So yes, water can save your life.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong><em>Exercise.</em></strong> Until now all the things I said are just those boring advice where you can find anywhere, but yes, exercise is important, no need to pull a 30 minutes cardio, just a simple 10-15 minutes stretching or jogging will make you feel much healthier.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong><em>Pay attention to your posture.</em></strong> This. Is. Crucial. You might already know I work front-of-house so I stand on an average 8-9 hrs/day and it is very important that your standing posture is correct because if not, your bones will start to dislocate or bend and you wouldn’t like the consequences that come after that. My knee is already fucked. I cannot stand up or sit down or jump or climb the stair without my knee screaming pain. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong><em>Don’t rely too much on medication.</em></strong> If you have a headache, take some rest if possible, don’t take panadol or tylenol, or any kind of painkiller just because it’s fast and effective. Medicines have side effects, almost every medicines does, so please be cautious when taking them. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong><em>Eat well.</em></strong> Take some time out to firgure out what your body needs, protein, calcium, vitamins, etc. Having a balance diet will also makes you feel better, take suplements if you need them, and don’t forget to eat vegies and fruits. My tips on this would be listen to your body, when your body is lack of a certain nutrition, it will respons in accordance, for instance if your gum or teeth started to bleed, it means you need vitamins, eat vegies and fruits, or if your nails are fragile and broken easily you need more calcium from your diet, or when you get dizzy when standing up too fast, you either need more iron. These simple knowledge you can learn from anywhere, you doctor, or some randome guy on internet.
